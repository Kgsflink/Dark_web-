# Dark_web-using termux
Setting up a secure server in Termux for accessing the dark web and downloading data involves a few steps. Please note that accessing the dark web has legal and ethical implications, and you should ensure you're using it responsibly and in compliance with the law.

Here's a basic guide to get you started:

1. **Install Termux**: If you haven't already, install Termux on your Android device from the Google Play Store.

2. **Update and Upgrade Packages**: Open Termux and run the following commands to update and upgrade the installed packages:

    ```bash
    pkg update
    pkg upgrade
    ```

3. **Install Required Packages**: Install the required packages for setting up a web server and accessing the dark web:

    ```bash
    pkg install python
    pkg install tor
    pkg install git
    ```

4. **Install Apache Web Server**: Install the Apache web server using the following command:

    ```bash
    pkg install apache2
    ```

5. **Start the Apache Web Server**: Start the Apache web server using:

    ```bash
    apachectl start
    ```

6. **Install and Configure Tor**: Install and configure Tor to access the dark web. First, install the Tor package:

    ```bash
    pkg install tor
    ```

    Then, start the Tor service:

    ```bash
    tor
    ```

7. **Download Data from the Dark Web**: You can use Tor to browse the dark web and download data. For example, you can use the `wget` command to download files:

    ```bash
    wget --tor --output-document=<output_file> <dark_web_url>
    ```

    Replace `<output_file>` with the name you want to give the downloaded file and `<dark_web_url>` with the URL of the file you want to download.

8. **Secure Your Server**: It's crucial to secure your server. Make sure you have a strong password for your server and consider setting up a firewall.

Please note that accessing the dark web can be risky, and it's important to be cautious. Always use a VPN and take necessary precautions to protect your privacy and security. Additionally, ensure that you are not violating any laws or regulations while accessing the dark web.

The message you're seeing is a warning from Apache indicating that it couldn't determine the server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN). This is a common warning and doesn't necessarily indicate a problem with your server.

However, if you want to suppress this warning, you can set the `ServerName` directive in the Apache configuration file. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the Apache configuration file for editing. In Termux, you can use the `nano` text editor:

    ```bash
    nano /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/etc/apache2/httpd.conf
    ```

2. Add the following line at the end of the file:

    ```
    ServerName localhost
    ```

3. Save the changes by pressing `Ctrl + O`, then press `Enter`, and exit the editor by pressing `Ctrl + X`.

4. Restart the Apache server:

    ```bash
    apachectl restart
    ```

Now, when you start Apache, you shouldn't see the warning message about the server's FQDN.

To check if the Apache web server is running on your Termux environment, you can use the `ps` command to list all running processes and then filter for the `httpd` process, which is the Apache web server process.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open Termux and run the following command:

    ```bash
    ps aux | grep httpd
    ```

2. If Apache is running, you should see a line that contains `httpd` in the output. If Apache is not running, you won't see any output.

Alternatively, you can use the `netstat` command to check if Apache is listening on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic. Here's how you can do it:

1. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    netstat -tuln | grep :80
    ```

2. If Apache is running, you should see a line that contains `:80` in the output. If Apache is not running, you won't see any output.

If Apache is not running, you can start it using the `apachectl start` command.

To stop the Apache web server in Termux, you can use the `apachectl` command with the `stop` option. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open Termux on your Android device.

2. Run the following command to stop the Apache web server:

    ```bash
    apachectl stop
    ```

3. If Apache was running, it should now be stopped.

Please note that stopping the Apache web server will prevent it from serving web pages, so make sure to stop it only if you no longer need it to be running.

To run a Tor instance in Termux, you can use the following command:

```bash
tor
```

This will start a Tor instance in the background. You can then configure your applications to use the Tor proxy for network connections.

For example, if you want to use the `curl` command to make a request through the Tor network, you can use the `--proxy` option to specify the Tor proxy:

```bash
curl --proxy socks5h://localhost:9050 http://example.com
```

This will make a request to `http://example.com` through the Tor network.

Similarly, if you want to use the `wget` command to download a file through the Tor network, you can use the `--proxy` option to specify the Tor proxy:

```bash
wget --proxy=on --proxy=socks5h://localhost:9050 http://example.com/file.zip
```

This will download the file `file.zip` from `http://example.com` through the Tor network.


Yes, you can use `w3m` or `torify` to access the dark web through Tor in Termux. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install Required Packages**: If you haven't already, install the `w3m` and `tor` packages:

    ```bash
    pkg install w3m
    pkg install tor
    ```

2. **Start Tor**: Start the Tor service by running the following command:

    ```bash
    tor
    ```

3. **Configure Tor**: Tor will automatically configure itself. Wait for a few seconds until you see a message indicating that Tor is ready.

4. **Run w3m with Tor**: You can use the `torify` command to run `w3m` with Tor. For example, to access the dark web using `w3m`, you can use the following command:

    ```bash
    torify w3m http://example.onion
    ```

    Replace `http://example.onion` with the URL of the dark web website you want to access.

Please note that accessing the dark web has legal and ethical implications, and you should ensure you're using it responsibly and in compliance with the law. Additionally, be aware that many dark web websites may contain illegal or harmful content, so exercise caution when browsing the dark web.

It seems that the `torify` command is trying to use `torsocks`, but it's not able to find it in your PATH. This may be because `torsocks` is not installed or because it's not located in a directory that is included in your PATH environment variable.

Since `torsocks` is no longer supported for security reasons, you can use `torify` with `torsocks` by installing `torsocks` in Termux. Here's how you can do it:

1. Install `torsocks`:

    ```bash
    pkg install torsocks
    ```

2. After installing `torsocks`, you should be able to use `torify` with `w3m`. For example:

    ```bash
    torify w3m http://example.onion
    ```

If you encounter any issues with the installation or usage of `torify` or `torsocks`, make sure to update your Termux packages (`pkg update && pkg upgrade`) and try again. If the issue persists, you may need to check the installation logs or seek further assistance.
